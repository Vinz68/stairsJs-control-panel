# stairsJs-control-panel
StairsLedLight control panel, build with ReactJS. It is a front-end (GUI client) for the automatic led-light server program of my stairs, which can be found here: https://github.com/Vinz68/stairsJs.
The server program (stairsJs repository) controls the led-streps on the stairs automatically based on the current sunset and sunrise times and using 2 passive infra red (PIR) sensors to detect the people who want to go up or down.
